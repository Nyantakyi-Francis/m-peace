                        <p class="board-bio">In 2020, Mprah Ruhaimatu established the Marvelous Touch Foundation (MATOF) with the visionary goal of
                        amplifying the female voice across Ghana. Her work is deeply rooted in the belief that empowering women is the catalyst
                        for broader societal transformation. As a dedicated gender activist, Ruhaimatu has
                        positioned herself as a beacon of hope for marginalized women in rural communities. By serving as an inspirational
                        speaker, she bridges the gap between advocacy and action, providing these women with the tools and confidence to
                        overcome systemic barriers.
                        
                        Beyond her grassroots activism, Ruhaimatu is a distinguished academic whose intellectual pursuits fuel her mission for
                        social equity. She currently serves as a lecturer at Mampong Technical College of Education, where she shapes the minds
                        of future educators. Her commitment to excellence is further evidenced by her status as a Ph.D. candidate in English
                        Language at the University of Education, Winneba.</p>
